# Auto-Load Testing Guide

## Setup
1. Backend is running at http://localhost:8000
2. Frontend is running at http://localhost:5173
3. Backend now includes `final_state` in trajectory responses

## Test Steps

### Test 1: Verify final_state in API
```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/comets/J96R020/trajectory?days=100&points=50&method=twobody" | jq '.final_state'
```

Expected: Should show position, velocity, and time

### Test 2: Manual Frontend Test
1. Open http://localhost:5173 in browser
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Select a comet (e.g., J96R020)
4. Click the "ðŸ”„ Auto" button to enable auto-load
5. Click "â–¶ Play" to start animation
6. Watch the console for "[Auto-Load]" messages

### Expected Behavior
- At ~80% through the trajectory (or 5s before end), you should see:
  ```
  [Auto-Load] Trigger conditions met, loading next segment...
  [Auto-Load] Loading next segment... {currentSegments: 0, currentPoints: 50}
  ```
- Then after loading:
  ```
  [Auto-Load] Segment loaded successfully {newPoints: 100, totalPoints: 150, segments: 1}
  ```
- The animation should continue smoothly without looping back to start
- The trajectory line should extend as new data is loaded

### Test 3: Check Network Tab
1. Open Network tab in browser dev tools
2. Filter by "continue"
3. Enable auto-load and play animation
4. You should see POST requests to `/trajectory/continue`
5. Check the request payload - should include state vector
6. Check the response - should include new trajectory points

### Debugging

If auto-load doesn't trigger:
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify `final_state` exists in initial trajectory
3. Check that `autoLoadEnabled` is true
4. Verify animation is playing
5. Check currentTimeIndex is incrementing

If auto-load triggers but data doesn't appear:
1. Check Network tab for the continuation request
2. Verify the response has trajectory data
3. Check if `onTrajectoryUpdate` is being called
4. Look for errors in console

## Current Status

âœ… Backend: `final_state` added to trajectory endpoint
âœ… Backend: Continuation endpoint working
âœ… Frontend: Auto-load hook implemented
âœ… Frontend: UI controls added
âœ… Frontend: Build successful

## Known Issues

- Animation loops back to start at end of trajectory
- Need to verify auto-load actually triggers in browser
- Need to verify trajectory update propagates to animation

## Next Steps

1. Test in browser with console open
2. Verify auto-load triggers
3. Verify continuation API is called
4. Verify trajectory is updated
5. Fix any issues found
