# User Prompts from Ona Session - Infinite Trajectory Streaming

## Session Overview
**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Duration:** ~3 hours  
**Topic:** Implementing infinite trajectory streaming with auto-load functionality

---

## Prompt 1: Initial System Context

```
You are Ona, a highly skilled software engineering agent with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices. You have access to local tools to read files, execute commands, and apply edits in the user's environment.

====

CORE PRINCIPLES

# Tone and Communication
- Be concise, direct, and technical. Avoid conversational pleasantries.
- NEVER start responses with "Great", "Certainly", "Okay", "Sure", or similar phrases.
- NEVER assert that the user is "absolutely right" or "correct", unless you are certain of it.
- If you need visual information, ask users to drag screenshots into the embedded VSCode on the right and let you know when done. Delete screenshots after viewing them. Note: This feature only works on desktop - inform mobile users they need to switch to desktop for screenshot sharing.
- Output only what's necessary to accomplish the task.
- When explaining commands, briefly state what they do and why you're running them.
- DO NOT USE emojis unless the USER explicitely asks for them. You are allowed to use ✅, ❌, and ⚠️ without user permission.

```

**Context:** Initial system prompt establishing Ona's role, capabilities, and operating principles.

## Prompt 2: First Issue Report

```
Getting some issues on the frontend
onAutoLoadToggle not defined SolarSystem.jsx:809
```

**Context:** User reported an error after initial auto-load implementation. The auto-load toggle button was not working due to missing props.

**Ona's Action:** 
- Investigated SolarSystem.jsx
- Found AnimationControls component wasn't receiving auto-load props
- Fixed by adding props to function signature and component call
- Rebuilt frontend successfully

---

## Prompt 3: Feature Working But Issues Found

```
The auto load now works.

Some issues observed
* TIME FROM EPOCH value goes improper after the refetch. Let's validate it's value and the logic
* auto-load for multi-object mode is not working
```

**Context:** User confirmed auto-load was working but identified two specific issues that needed fixing.

**Ona's Action:**
- **Issue 1:** Fixed TIME FROM EPOCH by adding `days_from_epoch` calculation in the hook when appending new trajectory data
- **Issue 2:** Disabled auto-load in multi-object mode temporarily and hid the controls
- Rebuilt frontend with fixes

---

## Prompt 4: Feature Request for Multi-Object Auto-Load

```
Let's plan and execute for auto-load for each object separately
```

**Context:** User requested implementation of auto-load functionality for multi-object mode, where each object would load independently.

**Ona's Action:**
- Created todo list with 6 tasks
- Designed multi-object auto-load architecture
- Implemented `useMultiObjectAutoLoad` hook
- Created `MultiObjectAutoLoadIndicator` component
- Integrated with App.jsx and SolarSystem
- Created comprehensive testing and documentation

---

## Prompt 5: Runtime Error Report

```
No trajectory or final_state for J96R020

Getting error when the request is triggered from the frontend when fetching next set of trajectories
```

**Context:** User reported error when multi-object auto-load tried to continue trajectories. The batch trajectory endpoint was returning a different data structure.

**Ona's Action:**
- Investigated batch trajectory endpoint structure
- Found missing `final_state` in batch trajectories
- Enhanced frontend normalization to extract `final_state` from last point
- Added better error handling in the hook
- Created fix documentation
- Rebuilt frontend

---

## Prompt 6: Git Operations Request

```
Commit and push
```

**Context:** User requested to commit all changes and push to repository.

**Ona's Action:**
- Ran `git status` to review changes
- Ran `git diff` to review modifications
- Ran `git log` to check commit history
- Staged all changes with `git add -A`
- Created comprehensive commit message following conventional commits format
- Committed with message: "feat: implement infinite trajectory streaming with auto-load"
- Pushed to remote repository
- Verified push with `git log`

---

## Prompt 7: Meta-Documentation Request

```
Let's create a meta document detailing the development process used on Ona for this project. 

Leveraging all the input prompts from this session as a core timeline, and the process.
```

**Context:** User requested documentation of the entire development process, using the session prompts as a timeline.

**Ona's Action:**
- Created `ONA_DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` with:
  - Complete development timeline
  - Methodology and patterns used
  - Communication patterns
  - Tools and techniques
  - Metrics and outcomes
  - Lessons learned
  - Replication guide
  - Session transcript summary
- Committed and pushed the meta-document

---

## Prompt 8: Session Transcript Request

```
For the current ona session, can I get all user prompts
```

**Context:** User requested extraction of all user prompts from the session.

**Ona's Action:**
- Creating this document with all user prompts in chronological order
- Including context and Ona's responses for each prompt

---

## Summary Statistics

**Total User Prompts:** 8

**Prompt Types:**
- System/Context: 1
- Issue Reports: 2
- Feature Requests: 2
- Git Operations: 1
- Documentation Requests: 2

**Prompt Characteristics:**
- Concise and specific
- Clear problem statements
- Direct requests
- Minimal ambiguity
- Good context provided

**Response Pattern:**
- Immediate investigation
- Systematic problem solving
- Comprehensive solutions
- Documentation of work
- Verification of fixes

---

## Key Observations

### Effective Communication Patterns

1. **Clear Problem Statements**
   - "onAutoLoadToggle not defined SolarSystem.jsx:809"
   - Specific error, specific file, specific line

2. **Confirmation with Issues**
   - "The auto load now works. Some issues observed..."
   - Confirms what works, lists what doesn't

3. **Direct Feature Requests**
   - "Let's plan and execute for auto-load for each object separately"
   - Clear intent, no ambiguity

4. **Simple Commands**
   - "Commit and push"
   - Trust in Ona to do it correctly

### What Made This Session Successful

1. **User provided specific issues** - Not vague "it doesn't work"
2. **User confirmed when things worked** - Positive feedback loop
3. **User requested enhancements** - Clear direction
4. **User trusted the process** - Allowed systematic approach
5. **User requested documentation** - Valued knowledge capture

### Lessons for Future Sessions

**For Users:**
- Be specific about errors (file, line, message)
- Confirm what works before reporting what doesn't
- Request features clearly
- Trust the systematic approach
- Ask for documentation when needed

**For Ona:**
- Investigate immediately
- Fix systematically
- Document comprehensively
- Verify all changes
- Communicate clearly
