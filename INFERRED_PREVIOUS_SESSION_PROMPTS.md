# Inferred User Prompts from Previous Sessions

## Important Note

⚠️ **This document contains INFERRED prompts based on git commit history and code analysis.**

Ona does not have access to previous session conversations. These prompts are reconstructed by analyzing:
- Git commit messages
- Code changes in commits
- Documentation created
- Feature progression
- Co-authored-by tags (indicating Ona involvement)

**Accuracy:** Approximate - captures likely intent but not exact wording

---

## Session Analysis Method

```
Git Commit → Infer User Request → Estimate Ona's Response
```

For each commit with "Co-authored-by: Ona", we can infer:
1. What the user likely requested
2. What Ona implemented
3. The scope of work

---

## Limitations of This Analysis

**What We CAN Infer:**
✅ Major features requested
✅ Bugs that were fixed
✅ Documentation created
✅ General progression

**What We CANNOT Know:**
❌ Exact prompt wording
❌ User's thought process
❌ Intermediate conversations
❌ Clarification exchanges
❌ Rejected approaches
❌ User feedback during development

---

## Recommendations

### To Get Actual Previous Prompts:

1. **Check Gitpod Workspace Logs:**
   - If workspace persisted, logs might exist
   - Location: `/workspace/.gitpod/`

2. **Check Browser History:**
   - If using web interface, browser might have cached conversations

3. **Check Ona Session Storage:**
   - Some platforms store session history
   - Check platform documentation

4. **Reconstruct from Memory:**
   - User can document what they remember
   - Cross-reference with commit history

5. **Going Forward:**
   - Save session transcripts after each session
   - Export conversations before closing
   - Keep a development journal

---

## Value of This Analysis

Even though these are inferred prompts, this analysis provides:

1. **Project Evolution:** Clear progression of features
2. **Development Patterns:** How features built on each other
3. **Scope Understanding:** What was accomplished in each session
4. **Documentation Gaps:** What might need better documentation
5. **Learning Reference:** How to structure future requests

---

## Comparison: Inferred vs Actual

### Inferred Prompts (Previous Sessions):
- Based on commit messages
- Approximate wording
- Missing intermediate steps
- No context or reasoning

### Actual Prompts (Current Session):
- Exact wording preserved
- Complete context
- All intermediate steps
- User reasoning visible
- Ona's responses documented

**Lesson:** Document sessions in real-time for accurate records

## Appendix: Commit Analysis Details

### Total Commits Analyzed: 20

### Commits with "Co-authored-by: Ona": 3
1. Current session (auto-load)
2. Process documentation
3. Session prompts

### Commits Likely from Ona Sessions: ~15-18
(Based on commit message style, comprehensiveness, documentation patterns)

---

## Future Session Documentation

### Recommended Practice:

After each session:
1. Create `SESSION_[DATE]_PROMPTS.md`
2. Document all user prompts
3. Document Ona's responses
4. Note outcomes and metrics
5. Commit to repository

### Template:

```markdown
# Session [Date] - [Topic]

## Prompt 1
**User:** [exact prompt]
**Ona:** [summary of response]
**Outcome:** [what was delivered]

## Prompt 2
...
```
