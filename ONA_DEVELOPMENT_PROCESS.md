## Ona's Development Methodology

### 1. Todo-Driven Development

**When to Use:**
- Complex tasks with multiple steps
- Features requiring coordination across files
- When planning is needed before coding

**How Ona Uses It:**
```javascript
// Start new task
todo_reset [
  "Step 1: Design",
  "Step 2: Implement core",
  "Step 3: Integrate",
  "Step 4: Test",
  "Step 5: Document"
]

// Progress through tasks
todo_next  // Completes current, starts next
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear progress tracking
- Prevents getting lost in complexity
- Ensures nothing is forgotten
- Provides structure to development

---

### 2. Design-First Approach

**Process:**
1. **Understand Requirements:** Clarify what needs to be built
2. **Create Design Document:** Architecture, data structures, decisions
3. **Review Trade-offs:** Document alternatives and choices
4. **Get Approval:** Ensure alignment before coding
5. **Implement:** Follow the design

**Example from This Project:**
- Created `MULTI_OBJECT_AUTO_LOAD_DESIGN.md` before coding
- Defined state management, queue system, memory management
- Made architectural decisions with rationale
- Result: Clean implementation that matched design

---

### 3. Incremental Implementation

**Pattern:**
```
Design → Core → Integration → UI → Testing → Documentation
```

**Why It Works:**
- Each step builds on previous
- Easy to verify at each stage
- Can catch issues early
- Natural progression

**Example:**
1. Design hook architecture
2. Implement hook logic
3. Integrate with App.jsx
4. Add UI components
5. Create test guides
6. Write documentation

---

### 4. Documentation-Driven Development

**Ona Creates Documentation:**
- **Before coding:** Design documents
- **During coding:** Inline comments (when needed)
- **After coding:** Implementation summaries
- **For testing:** Test guides
- **For fixes:** Fix documentation

**Types of Documents Created:**
- Design documents (architecture, decisions)
- Implementation summaries (what was built)
- Test guides (how to verify)
- Fix documentation (what broke, how fixed)
- Process documentation (this document)

---

### 5. Error Handling Philosophy

**Ona's Approach to Errors:**

1. **Read Error Carefully:** Understand exact problem
2. **Locate Source:** Find where error originates
3. **Understand Context:** Why is this happening?
4. **Fix Root Cause:** Not just symptoms
5. **Add Prevention:** Improve error handling
6. **Document Fix:** Help future debugging

**Example from This Project:**
- Error: "No trajectory or final_state"
- Root cause: Batch endpoint different format
- Fix: Normalize on frontend
- Prevention: Better error messages
- Documentation: Fix document created

---

### 6. Testing Strategy

**Ona's Testing Approach:**

1. **Unit-level:** Test individual functions
2. **Integration:** Test component interactions
3. **End-to-end:** Test full user flows
4. **Performance:** Test memory and speed
5. **Edge cases:** Test error scenarios

**Documentation Over Automation:**
- Creates comprehensive test guides
- Documents expected behavior
- Provides verification steps
- Enables manual testing

**Why:** For rapid development, documented manual tests are faster than writing automated tests

---

## Communication Patterns

### 1. Concise Technical Communication

**Ona's Style:**
- Direct and technical
- No pleasantries ("Great!", "Sure!", etc.)
- Focus on facts and actions
- Clear explanations when needed

**Example:**
```
❌ "Great question! Let me help you with that..."
✅ "The issue is in AnimationControls. Adding missing props..."
```

---

### 2. Proactive Problem Solving

**Pattern:**
1. User reports issue
2. Ona investigates immediately
3. Ona proposes solution
4. Ona implements if approved
5. Ona verifies fix

**Example:**
- User: "Getting error X"
- Ona: Reads code, finds issue, proposes fix
- Ona: Implements fix, rebuilds, verifies
- Ona: Documents fix for future reference

---

### 3. Transparent Decision Making

**Ona Explains:**
- Why choosing approach A over B
- Trade-offs of decisions
- Implications of changes
- Alternative options considered

**Example:**
```markdown
**Decision:** Frontend normalization vs backend changes

**Rationale:**
- Frontend: Simple, fast, no breaking changes
- Backend: Cleaner but complex, requires testing

**Choice:** Frontend normalization
```

---

## Tools & Techniques

- Read relevant sections (not entire files)
- Read related files (understand dependencies)

**Editing Strategy:**
- Use str_replace for precision
- Match exact strings (whitespace matters)
- Verify changes after editing

---

### 2. Command Execution

**Principles:**
- Use relative paths
- Chain with && for error propagation
- Check output for errors
- Verify success

**Example:**
```bash
cd frontend && npm run build 2>&1 | tail -10
```

---

### 3. Git Operations

**Workflow:**
1. Check status
2. Review changes (diff)
3. Check commit history
4. Stage changes
5. Write clear commit message
6. Push
7. Verify

**Commit Message Format:**
```
type: brief description
