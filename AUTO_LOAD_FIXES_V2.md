# Auto-Load Fixes - Version 2

## Issues Fixed

### âœ… Issue 1: TIME FROM EPOCH Goes Improper After Refetch

**Problem:** 
When new trajectory segments were loaded via auto-load, the `days_from_epoch` field was missing from the continuation endpoint response. This caused the time display to show incorrect values or undefined.

**Root Cause:**
The continuation endpoint (`/trajectory/continue`) only returns `time` (Julian Date) for each point, not `days_from_epoch`. The initial trajectory endpoint includes `days_from_epoch` because it knows the epoch, but the continuation endpoint doesn't have that context.

**Solution:**
Calculate `days_from_epoch` on the frontend when appending new trajectory data:

```javascript
// Get the original epoch from the first trajectory point
const originalEpoch = trajectory.start_time || trajectory.trajectory[0]?.time

// Add days_from_epoch to new trajectory points
const newTrajectoryWithEpoch = data.trajectory.map(point => ({
  ...point,
  days_from_epoch: point.time - originalEpoch
}))
```

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/hooks/useTrajectoryAutoLoad.js`

**Verification:**
1. Enable auto-load
2. Start animation
3. Watch the "TIME FROM EPOCH" display
4. After auto-load triggers, the time should continue incrementing smoothly
5. Should show values like: "150.0 days (0.41 years)" after first continuation

### âœ… Issue 2: Auto-Load Not Working in Multi-Object Mode

**Problem:**
Auto-load controls were visible in multi-object mode, but didn't work because the hook only supports single trajectories.

**Root Cause:**
The auto-load hook is designed for a single trajectory object. In multi-object mode, we have `batchTrajectories` (an object with multiple trajectories), not a single `trajectory`. Supporting multi-object auto-load would require:
- Tracking auto-load state for each object separately
- Triggering continuation for each object independently
- Managing memory for multiple growing trajectories
- Coordinating animation timing across objects

**Solution:**
Disable auto-load in multi-object mode:

1. **Hook level:** Only enable when not in multi-object mode
   ```javascript
   enabled: autoLoadEnabled && !multiObjectMode
   ```

2. **UI level:** Hide auto-load controls in multi-object mode
   ```javascript
   {onAutoLoadToggle && !batchTrajectories && (
     // Auto-load controls
   )}
   ```

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/App.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/SolarSystem.jsx`

**Verification:**
1. Switch to multi-object mode (click "ðŸ“Š Multi" button)
2. Auto-load controls should disappear
3. Switch back to single mode (click "ðŸŽ¯ Single" button)
4. Auto-load controls should reappear

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: TIME FROM EPOCH Display
- [ ] Enable auto-load in single-object mode
- [ ] Start animation
- [ ] Wait for auto-load to trigger (at ~80%)
- [ ] Verify time continues incrementing smoothly
- [ ] Check that time doesn't reset or show NaN
- [ ] Verify time shows correct values (e.g., 150 days after first continuation)

### Test 2: Multi-Object Mode
- [ ] Switch to multi-object mode
- [ ] Verify auto-load button is hidden
- [ ] Verify settings button is hidden
- [ ] Animation should still work normally
- [ ] Switch back to single mode
- [ ] Verify auto-load controls reappear

### Test 3: Multiple Continuations
- [ ] Enable auto-load
- [ ] Let animation run through multiple continuations
- [ ] Verify time continues incrementing: 100 â†’ 200 â†’ 300 days
- [ ] Check console for successful load messages
- [ ] Verify trajectory extends visually

### Test 4: Settings Persistence
- [ ] Open auto-load settings
- [ ] Change segment duration to 200 days
- [ ] Save settings
- [ ] Enable auto-load and start animation
- [ ] Verify next segment is 200 days (check console logs)

## Console Output Examples

### Successful Auto-Load with Correct Time
```
[Auto-Load] Trigger conditions met, loading next segment...
[Auto-Load] Loading next segment... {currentSegments: 0, currentPoints: 100}
[Auto-Load] Requesting continuation from time: 2461307.7238
[Auto-Load] Received 100 new points
[Auto-Load] Segment loaded successfully {newPoints: 100, totalPoints: 200, segments: 1}
```

### Time Display Values
- Initial: "0.0 days (0.00 years)" â†’ "100.0 days (0.27 years)"
- After 1st continuation: "100.0 days" â†’ "200.0 days (0.55 years)"
- After 2nd continuation: "200.0 days" â†’ "300.0 days (0.82 years)"

## Known Limitations

### Multi-Object Auto-Load
**Status:** Not implemented

**Reason:** 
Implementing auto-load for multiple objects simultaneously is complex and requires:
- Per-object state management
- Coordinated loading to avoid overwhelming the backend
- Memory management across multiple trajectories
- UI to show loading status for each object

**Workaround:**
Use single-object mode for auto-load functionality. Multi-object mode is designed for comparing static trajectories.

**Future Enhancement:**
Could be implemented in a future version with:
- Queue-based loading (one object at a time)
- Shared memory pool across objects
- Per-object auto-load toggle
- Batch continuation endpoint

## Files Changed

### Frontend
1. **`frontend/src/hooks/useTrajectoryAutoLoad.js`**
   - Added `days_from_epoch` calculation when appending new trajectory data
   - Uses original epoch from first trajectory point
   - Maps over new points to add the field

2. **`frontend/src/App.jsx`**
   - Disabled auto-load hook when in multi-object mode
   - Added `&& !multiObjectMode` condition to enabled flag

3. **`frontend/src/components/SolarSystem.jsx`**
   - Hidden auto-load controls in multi-object mode
   - Added `&& !batchTrajectories` condition to control visibility

---

## Build Status

âœ… Frontend build successful
âœ… No TypeScript/JavaScript errors
âœ… All components compiled
âœ… Bundle size: ~1.04 MB (294 KB gzipped)

---

## Deployment Notes

1. **No backend changes required** - All fixes are frontend-only
2. **No database migrations** - No data structure changes
3. **No breaking changes** - Existing functionality preserved
4. **Backward compatible** - Works with existing trajectories

---

## Success Criteria

âœ… TIME FROM EPOCH displays correctly after auto-load
âœ… Time values continue incrementing smoothly
âœ… No NaN or undefined values in time display
âœ… Auto-load controls hidden in multi-object mode
âœ… Auto-load disabled in multi-object mode
âœ… Single-object mode auto-load works as expected
âœ… Multiple continuations work correctly
âœ… Console logs show correct time values

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test in browser** - Verify both fixes work as expected
2. **Monitor console** - Check for any errors or warnings
3. **Long-running test** - Let auto-load run for 5+ segments
4. **Performance check** - Verify no memory leaks with extended trajectories

---

## Future Enhancements

### Multi-Object Auto-Load (Future)
If needed, could implement with:
- `useMultiObjectAutoLoad` hook
- Per-object continuation tracking
- Staggered loading (avoid simultaneous requests)
- Shared memory management
- UI indicators for each object's loading state

### Improved Time Display
- Show absolute date/time (not just days from epoch)
- Add time range selector
- Show perihelion/aphelion markers
- Display orbital period progress

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for distant trajectory segments
- Level of Detail (LOD) for far segments
- Compression for old trajectory data
- IndexedDB caching for loaded segments
