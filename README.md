# Comet Trajectory Visualization System

An interactive 3D solar system viewer that accurately plots the positions and future trajectories of all known comets using real astronomical data.

## Features

- **Real Data**: Ingests data from Minor Planet Center (MPC) with 1,141 comets
- **Accurate Physics**: Choose between fast two-body or accurate N-body propagation with planetary perturbations
- **SPICE Integration**: Uses JPL DE440 ephemeris for high-precision planetary positions
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive WebGL-based solar system viewer with planetary orbits
- **Method Comparison**: Switch between two-body and N-body methods to see the difference
- **Detailed Information**: View orbital parameters and trajectory statistics

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- pip and npm

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m app.main
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Architecture

The system consists of three main layers:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Downloads and parses astronomical data from MPC and JPL
2. **Physics Engine**: Calculates orbital mechanics and propagates trajectories
3. **Visualization**: Renders 3D solar system with interactive controls

See [TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md](TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP âœ…
