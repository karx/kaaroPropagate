**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Animation loop updates current position index
useEffect(() => {
  if (!animationPlaying) return
  
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    setCurrentTimeIndex(prev => {
      if (prev >= maxIndex) return 0 // Loop
      return prev + 1
    })
  }, 100 / animationSpeed) // Faster speed = shorter interval
  
  return () => clearInterval(interval)
}, [animationPlaying, animationSpeed])
```

**User Experience**:
- Click Play to watch the comet move along its orbit
- Drag scrubber to jump to any point in time

```javascript
// Calculate direction from consecutive points
const direction = [
  next.position.x - curr.position.x,
  next.position.z - curr.position.z,
  -(next.position.y - curr.position.y)
]

// Orient arrow using quaternion
arrowRef.current.quaternion.setFromUnitVectors(
  new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0),
  new THREE.Vector3(...direction).normalize()
)
```

- Arrow head shows direction
- Updates as comet moves

**Purpose**: Shows instantaneous velocity magnitude and direction, illustrating how speed changes along the orbit.

**Physics**:
```javascript
// Calculate velocity from position change
const velocity = [
  (next.position.x - curr.position.x) / dt,
  (next.position.z - curr.position.z) / dt,
  -(next.position.y - curr.position.y) / dt
]

// Scale for visibility
const scaledVelocity = velocity.map(v => v * 5)
```

**User Experience**:
- See how velocity changes along orbit
- Faster near perihelion (longer arrow)

- Easy to track during animation
- Clear focal point for observation

## Physics Concepts Illustrated

### 1. Kepler's Second Law (Equal Areas)

**Observation**: Velocity vector is longer near perihelion, shorter near aphelion

**Explanation**: The comet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. To cover more distance near the Sun (where orbit is tighter), it must move faster.

**Visual Evidence**:
- Watch velocity vector length change during animation
- Note faster motion near perihelion marker
- Observe slower motion near aphelion marker

### 2. Conservation of Energy

**Observation**: Kinetic energy (velocity) and potential energy (distance) trade off

**Explanation**: 
- Near perihelion: High velocity, low potential energy
- Near aphelion: Low velocity, high potential energy
- Total energy remains constant

**Visual Evidence**:
- Velocity highest when distance is smallest
- Velocity lowest when distance is largest
- Physics overlay shows both values

### 3. Orbital Direction

**Observation**: All comets orbit in consistent direction

**Explanation**: Comets orbit counterclockwise when viewed from above the ecliptic plane (north), following the same direction as planets.

**Visual Evidence**:
- Direction arrows show consistent flow
- Animation follows natural orbital motion
- Velocity vectors point along trajectory

### 4. Elliptical Orbits

**Observation**: Distance from Sun varies along orbit

**Explanation**: Orbits are ellipses with the Sun at one focus. Distance varies from perihelion (closest) to aphelion (farthest).

**Visual Evidence**:
- Perihelion and aphelion markers show extremes
- Distance value changes during animation
- Orbit shape is clearly elliptical

### 5. Planetary Perturbations (Comparison Mode)

**Observation**: Two-body and N-body trajectories diverge over time

**Explanation**: Planetary gravity causes deviations from pure Keplerian orbits. The difference grows with time.

**Visual Evidence**:
- Enable comparison mode
- Watch both trajectories during animation
- Note increasing separation
- Observe different velocities at same time

## User Interface Integration

└──────────────────────┘
```

**Information Hierarchy**:
1. Current physics values (most important)
2. Legend (reference information)
3. Color-coded for quick scanning

## Performance Considerations

### Animation Performance

**Frame Rate**: 60 FPS (Three.js rendering)  
**Update Rate**: 10 FPS (animation state updates)  
**Reason**: Decoupling animation logic from render loop prevents performance issues

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Animation updates at controlled rate
setInterval(() => {
  setCurrentTimeIndex(prev => prev + 1)
}, 100 / animationSpeed) // 10 FPS base rate

// Three.js renders at 60 FPS independently
useFrame(() => {
  // Smooth rendering
})
```

### Memory Usage

**Additional Memory**:
- Direction arrows: ~8 objects per trajectory
- Velocity vector: 2 objects (line + cone)
- Markers: 2 objects (perihelion + aphelion)
- Total: ~15 additional 3D objects

**Impact**: Negligible (<1MB additional memory)

### Computation

**Per Frame**:
- Calculate current position: O(1)
- Calculate velocity: O(1)
- Update UI: O(1)

**Total**: No performance impact on animation

## Accessibility Features
